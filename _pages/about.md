This is my personal GitHub page. I am a bioinformatician in the Department of Anatomy at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. This site will be the central place to link to my GitHub projects and repositories. I have added some basic (but hopefully useful) scripts, but will populate this site with more content as they are developed. 


Teaching Resources
======
I have been running a bioinformatics help session in the Anatomy department tea room. This was postponed during the pandemic but will be starting again soon. Most of the material from these sessions is available on the hacky hour webpage. These sessions range from getting started writing scripts to some guidelines on troubleshooting command line errors. More material will be coming soon.

As part of the Otago Carpentries group (main link) I have helped put on frequent workshops and training sessions. Here is a link to past workshops, which contain a great deal of content. The Bioinformatics Spring School, held in November, 2020, provides a framework for future large events through Otago Carpentries. It consisted of both basic lessons and specific training in several areas, such as gene expression and population genetics.

I have taught several workshops on environmental DNA (eDNA), and organised an eDNA conference attended by researchers from throughout New Zealand and the Pacific region. As part of the conference, I taught a one-day workshop on metabarcoding, which included an optional day for beginners to learn the basics of the command line and R. This was organised with the help of Otago Carpentries. We ran the workshop again as part of the Bioinformatics Spring School.

The growing interest in environmental DNA has led to the creation of an eDNA Hub at the University of Otago. Our inaugural meeting will be held on 25 March. This initiative was organised by Dr. Tina Summerfield (Department of Botany) and myself. The Hub is supported by Genetics Otago and Genomics Aotearoa. 

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
