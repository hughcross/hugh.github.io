title: "Stress, novel sex genes and epigenetic reprogramming orchestrate socially-controlled sex change"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'Bluehead wrasses undergo dramatic, socially cued female-to-male sex change. We apply transcriptomic and methyl- ome approaches in this wild coral reef fish to identify the primary trigger and subsequent molecular cascade of gonadal metamorphosis. Our data suggest that the environmental stimulus is exerted via the stress axis and that repression of the aromatase gene (encoding the enzyme converting androgens to estrogens) triggers a cascaded collapse of feminizing gene expression and identifies notable sex-specific gene neofunctionalization. Further- more, sex change involves distinct epigenetic reprogramming and an intermediate state with altered epigenetic machinery expression akin to the early developmental cells of mammals. These findings reveal at a molecular level how a normally committed developmental process remains plastic and is reversed to completely alter organ structures.'
